We used AI to fix some tests, specifically I asked the AI for help on debugging the tests.

I used microsoft copilot to ask it questions about static files, and with help writing test cases. I didn't copy paste the test cases and wrote most of them myself but I asked it questions when I ran into problems.

I used AI more specifically chatGPT to help me design the landing page. It helped me a lot with Bootstrap and do some cooler stuff than what I knew was available. It also helped me generate images for the landing page, and include them on there. 
I at first wanted to draw things out, but it was cool to see how chat was able to draw it for me and make it look a lot nicer and cohesive. I also used AI when I got stuck and didn't know why I was getting errors and blank pages. This was because I kept being on wrong branches and I realized where some of the work was stored as I kept working. Chat helped me realize why I had a blank page appear. It was logged in the entire time and there was no log out since I was in the wrong branch. Felt like a stupid mistake but this was my learning!
